inter alea is an experiment in emergent rhythmic interplay between two independent aleatoric systems. Two microcontrollers run the same code, each controlling a set of four solenoid coils. The solenoids loop in a random order and at a random speed until deciding to stop, at which point the order and speed are randomised anew. Despite the simplicity of the program, dynamic patterns emerge.

microcontrollers: 2 x adafruit feather m0 express  
solenoids: 4 x adafruit large push pull solenoid, 4 x adafruit small push pull solenoid

the max patch is a slightly hacky re-creation of the circuitpython program for those who prefer it
